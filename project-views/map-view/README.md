# Map View

Map View is the most useful view for **team members in Project Management/Product Ownership hat** as the Map View gives an overview of the project status as a whole.&#x20;

### Switching Between Project Views

You can switch between different project views (Map View, [Table View](../table-view.md) and [High Priority View](../high-priority-view.md)) by clicking on their associated icon in the top left header when inside a project.
