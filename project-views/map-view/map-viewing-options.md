# Map Viewing Options

In Map View you can customize your viewing options for the following:

1. **Layout Algorithm**: We have included three different options including **Classic**, **Minimum** **Height**, and **Minimum Width** to choose from.
2. **By Achievement Status**: You have the option to hide all Achieved Outcomes from view, or show them all.
3. **By Scope**: You have the option to hide all Small Scoped Outcomes from view, or show them all.

To access these map viewing options, simply click on the Eye icon at the bottom left side of the Map View right next to zooming toggles.
