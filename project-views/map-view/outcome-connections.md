# Outcome Connections

On Map View the Outcomes and their dependency relationships are displayed and can be modified. These relationships are called **Connections** and shown as lines between each two Outcomes that are related. All Outcome Connections are **Parent-Child** relationships.

**Ancestors** of an Outcome are the Parents of that Outcome's Parent.

**Descendants** of an Outcome are the Children of that Outcome's Children.&#x20;

### **Connecting two Outcomes far from each other in Map View**

2. Click on the two Outcomes one by one while holding Shift Key to select both of them.
3. A menu appears at the bottom of the Map View screen. Click on the **Outcome Connection icon** on the left of the menu. A popup appears.
4. Inside the popup, choose the Parent and the Child Outcome.
5. Hit Save button.

### Changing the Parent of an Outcome

If an Outcome has an existing Parent, the purple dot above that Outcome has the function of **re-assigning** the Parent:

1. Click and drag from the **top purple dot** it to remove the existing connection line.
2. Drag the connection line to the **bottom** of a different Outcome (to become the Parent) OR release in empty space to create a new Outcome and make that new Outcome the Parent at the same time.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have done this in error, simply hit **Escape** key before releasing your mouse/trackpad to reverse your action.  &#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Re-assigning a Child for an Outcome

If you want to disconnect a Child from an Outcome and at the same time connect it to a diffrent Outcome:

1. Click and drag from the **bottom purple dot** it to remove the existing connection line.
2. Drag the connection line to the **top** of a different Outcome (to become the Child) OR release in empty space to create a new Outcome and make that new Outcome a Child at the same time.
