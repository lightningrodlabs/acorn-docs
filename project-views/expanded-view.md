# Expanded View

An Expanded View of an Outcome shows you all the details and metadata related to the Outcome and let's you modify the information related to that Outcome.&#x20;

### Entering the Expanded View for an Outcome

* **Map View:** Double click on any Outcome or while selected on an Outcome (with blue borders) use Enter key.
* **Table View:** Click on the Outcome's statement.
* **Priority View:** Hover over the High Prioruty Outcome'x box and then click on the Expand Icon on top left side of the box.

### **Expanded View variations based on the Outcome's Scope**

Depending on the Scope of the Outcome you find slightly different options on the right and left columns of the Expanded View. For example:

* Small Scope Outcome has [Tasklist](../outcomes/tasklist.md) tab on the left but Big and Uncertain Scope Outcomes have [Children List ](../outcomes/children-list.md)tab instead.&#x20;
* The [Achievement Status](../outcomes/achievement-status.md) for Big Scope Outcome is entirely computed and can't be manually changed.
* If an Outcome doesn't have children you have the option to toggle the [Scope](../outcomes/outcome-scope.md) between Uncertain and Small.
* Only Uncertain Scope Outcome can be marked as **In Breakdown** mode.
