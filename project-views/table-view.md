# Table View

The Table View displays the project Outcomes and their properties (including project **ID number**, **Outcome Statement**, **Progress Indicator**, and **Assignees**) in a table format.

At the top of the page, you are able to select filters to apply to the table, in order to reduce the amount of Outcomes you are seeing at once. This can be helpful particularly for finding Outcomes that you yourself are '[assigned](../outcomes/assignees.md) to', or limiting Outcomes to those with a certain Tag or [Tags](../outcomes/tags.md).

Table View is most useful for **team members in 'doer' hat**.
