# High Priority Outcomes

You can mark an Outcome as High Priority to give it extra attention among other Outcomes in your project. You can have more than one High Priority Outcomes at once in your project.

When an Outcome is marked as High Priority it will:

* gain a "glow" in the [Map View](../project-views/map-view/) and is easily identifiable.
* will appear in the [High Priority View](../project-views/high-priority-view.md).
