# Ancestors Breadcrumbs

On Expanded View there are **Breadcrumbs** for the Ancestors of the selected Outcomes on the top left corner of the screen.&#x20;

The Outcome Statement of the direct Parent and also the very first Ancestor is displayed. Any Ancestor in between the these two are displayed as three dots.

You can navigate to the Parent or an Ancestor of the Outcome directly by clicking on it in the Breadcrumbs.
