# Children List

If an Outcome has Children, you would be able to see its Children as a list on **Expanded View. Click on the Children tab on the left column** and to the Outcome's Children and to navigate to a Child Outcome.&#x20;

In **Table View**, you would also be able to see an Outcome's Children by clicking the **Chevron** icon (next to the Outcome's Statement and [Progress Indicator](progress-indicator.md)) to expand the Children of that Outcome.
