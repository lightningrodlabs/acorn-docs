# Entry Point Outcomes

You can mark an Outcome as being an "Entry Point" to make it a point of access in the project, which you can jump to directly from the [Projects Dashboard](../projects/projects-dashboard.md). You can have more than one Entry Point at once in your project.

When an Outcome is marked as Entry Point it will:

* appear in you Projects Dashboard under your project's Entry Points list.
* in project's Map View, will appear in Entry Points list, which can be accessed by clicking on the **Entry Points Icon (Doorway)** on the top left header.&#x20;
