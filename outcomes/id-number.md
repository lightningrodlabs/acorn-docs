# ID Number

Every Outcome has a 6-digit ID Number that is **randomly and automatically** set upon creation of that Outcome.&#x20;

ID Number is useful for addressing and referring to a specific Outcome without the need to mention the Outcome Statement (Outcome Statement can be updated and changed at any time).&#x20;

The ID Number of an Outcome is displayed both on the Expanded View of that Outcome (top left side of the card) and also in Table View (left side of the Outcome Statement column).

{% hint style="info" %}
The ID Number of an exisitng Outcome cannot be changed.
{% endhint %}
